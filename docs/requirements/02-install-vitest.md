## Description

Install and configure **Vitest** into the Vite React Typescript project.

### Requirements

- Setup with React Testing Library for component testing
- Configuration of Testing Library User Event for simulating user interactions
- Use `jsdom` for DOM manipulation and assertions
- Use `@vitest/coverage-v8` for code coverage reporting
- Use `@vitest/ui` for a visual interface
- Configure the code coverage threshold at 80% for all metrics

### Setup file

Create a setup file at `src/test/setup.ts` to configure the testing environment:

```typescript
import '@testing-library/jest-dom/vitest';

// Add any global test setup here
```
