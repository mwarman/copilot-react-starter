# Requirement: Application Header Component

## Overview

The application header is a critical UI element that provides branding and consistent navigation experience across the "Task Hero" application. This document outlines the requirements for implementing a responsive and accessible header component that will appear on all pages of the application.

## Requirements

### Technical Requirements

- Create a reusable header component in the common components directory
  - File location: `src/common/components/Header/Header.tsx`
  - Co-located test file: `src/common/components/Header/Header.test.tsx`
- Implement with TypeScript and React
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Utilize shadcn/ui components where appropriate
- Ensure the header is fully responsive across all device sizes

## User Experience / Design

### Layout & Appearance

- The header should span the full width of the viewport
- Use the Lucide "BadgeCheck" icon as the application logo on the left side of the header
- The application name "Task Hero" should be positioned on the left side, next to the logo
- Use a large, bold font for the application name (text-2xl font-bold)
- When the application name is clicked it should navigate to the base route
- Background color should be consistent with the application theme
- Include a bottom border to visually separate the header from content
- Apply appropriate padding and spacing according to design system
- Height should be appropriate for both desktop and mobile views

### Accessibility

- Use semantic HTML (header tag)
- Ensure proper color contrast for readability
- Text should be readable at all screen sizes

## Navigation

_Not applicable for initial implementation. Future versions may include navigation elements._

## API Integration

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The header displays on all pages of the application

3. The application name links to the base route '/' of the application
4. The header is responsive and displays correctly on mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
5. The header styling is consistent with the application's theme
6. The component passes all accessibility tests
