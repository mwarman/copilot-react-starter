# Requirement: Delete a Task

## Overview

This document outlines the requirements for implementing task deletion functionality in the Task UI application. Users should be able to delete existing tasks from both the task list and task detail views.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- Users must be able to delete tasks from the task list view
- Users must be able to delete tasks from the task detail view
- A confirmation dialog must be shown before deletion occurs
- After successful deletion from detail view, users should be redirected to the task list

### Technical Requirements

- Implement a `useDeleteTask` hook using React Query mutations
- Use shadcn/ui components for consistent styling
- Include loading states during deletion process
- Handle and display error states appropriately
- Write comprehensive unit tests for all components

### Accessibility Requirements

- All buttons must have appropriate aria labels
- Confirmation dialog must be keyboard navigable
- Error messages must be announced to screen readers

## User Experience / Design

### Delete Buttons

- In list view: Include a delete icon button on each task item
- In detail view: Add a delete button in the actions bar area
- Use Lucide React for delete icons

### States

- **Loading**: Show a loading indicator while deletion is in progress
- **Error**: Display an error alert if deletion fails with retry option
- **Success**: Provide visual confirmation of successful deletion

### Confirmation Dialog

- Show a confirmation dialog before proceeding with deletion
- Clearly communicate that deletion is permanent
- Provide options to confirm or cancel the deletion

## Navigation

- After successful deletion from the detail view, redirect user to the task list view
- No navigation change is needed when deleting from the list view

## API Integration

- Handle optimistic updates for immediate UI feedback

### Endpoint

```
DELETE /tasks/{taskId}
```
