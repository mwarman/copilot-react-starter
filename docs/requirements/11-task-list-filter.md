# Requirement: Task List Filter Buttons

## Overview

The Task List Filter Buttons feature enhances the existing task management interface by allowing users to quickly filter tasks based on their completion status and due dates. By implementing toggleable filter buttons for "Complete," "Incomplete," and "Overdue" tasks, users can efficiently organize and prioritize their task list with visual feedback.

## Requirements

1. Implement three toggleable filter buttons in the task filter bar:

   - **Complete**: Display only completed tasks
   - **Incomplete**: Display only incomplete tasks
   - **Overdue**: Display only tasks that are past their due date and incomplete

2. Enable multi-filter selection allowing users to combine filters (e.g., show both incomplete and overdue tasks)

3. Integrate the new filtering capability with the existing search functionality:

   - Filters should apply to search results when search text is present
   - When filters are toggled, they should narrow down the current search results

4. Extend the task filtering hook to support the new filter parameters

5. Ensure the filter state persists when navigating away and returning to the task list

6. Implement client-side filtering for immediate feedback

7. Add comprehensive test coverage for the new filtering capabilities

## User Experience / Design

1. **Button Design**:

   - Use the shadcn/ui `Button` component with the following states:
     - Inactive: Outline variant
     - Active: Default/filled variant
   - Include appropriate Lucide React icons:
     - Complete: `CheckCircle`
     - Incomplete: `Circle`
     - Overdue: `Clock`

2. **Layout**:

   - Position buttons in the existing filter bar after the search input
   - Apply proper spacing between buttons
   - Ensure responsive design (buttons stack on smaller screens)

3. **Interaction**:
   - Buttons toggle on/off independently
   - When a filter is active, provide a clear visual indicator
   - When no filters are active, display all tasks
   - Filter changes should update the task list immediately

## API Integration

No new API integration is required. This feature implements client-side filtering of existing data.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Users can toggle each filter button (Complete, Incomplete, Overdue) independently
2. Active filters have clear visual indication
3. Task list updates immediately when filters are toggled
4. Multiple filters can be combined correctly
5. Filters work in conjunction with the existing search functionality
6. UI is responsive and consistent with the existing design
7. Filter states persist when navigating away and returning to the task list
8. All tests pass, including:
   - Unit tests for filter logic
   - Component tests for filter buttons
   - Updated existing tests to account for new filtering capabilities
