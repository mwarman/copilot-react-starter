| SK-01          | Home page           | As a user I want to view the home page when I first access the application.                                        | The system should display the home page as the default route of the application. The home page should contain sections of content which describe the purpose of the application to a new user. The text should be in a slightly larger font and easy to read.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| SK-02          | Application header  | As a user I would like to have an application header displayed on every page.                                      | The application uses a standard page layout which includes the header and a main content area for the page-specific content. The application name is prominantly displayed in the header justified on the left side. The header content is vertically centered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| SK-03          | Application footer  | As a user I would like to have an application footer displayed on every page.                                      | The application uses a standard page layout which includes the footer which appears below the main page content. The footer contains a copyright year. The footer contains the text "learnBYdoing" to the right of the copyright. The footer content is centered vertically and horizontally.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| SK-04          | Theme toggle        | As a user I would like to be able to toggle between light and dark themes.                                         | The application should attempt to detect the system theme on load. The theme toggle button is located in the application header, justified to the right side of the header. The theme toggle button should toggle between light and dark themes. The theme toggle button should use an icon only, no text. The theme toggle button should depict an icon which reflects the theme state, either light or dark. The theme toggle should work with Tailwind CSS built-in dark mode. The theme toggle should use the shadcn/ui common Button component.                                                                                                                                              |
| SK-05          | Documentation pages | As a user, I would like to have a family of "documentation" pages with various sub-pages containing documentation. | The application has a documentation family of pages. Provide a link to the documentation family from the home page. The first sub-page in the documentation page family is the "Introduction" page. The content of the Introduction page provides an overview of this application. The sections of the Introduction page include: About this application; What is a starter kit; About using Copilot with VS Code; About creating a React application with Copilot. The Introduction page has a table of contents with links to the introduction page sections. The application should automatically navigate to the "Introduction" page if the user navigates to the base "documentation" route. |
