| HP-01          | Create home page  | As a user I want to view the home page when I first access the application.                         | The system should display the home page as the default route of the application.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| HP-02          | Welcome message   | As a user I want to be greeted with a prominent welcome message.                                    | The welcome message is styled as a hero block. Welcome message is visible on page load. Welcome message text is: "Welcome to the Copilot Playground".                                                                                                   |
| HP-03          | Side navigation   | As a user I want to be able to easily navigate the application using a side menu.                   | The side menu is located on the left. The menu is collapsible. The menu contains links to About, Contact, and Help pages. The menu is displayed at medium and larger viewport sizes, but defaults to hidden at smaller viewport sizes.                  |
| HP-04          | Featured content  | As a user I want to be able to see featured content.                                                | The featured content should be organized into a grid of cards. Featured content should be located immediately below the welcome message. The grid should display 1 card at the smallest viewport size and at most 5 cards at the largest viewport size. |
| HP-05          | Responsive layout | As a user I want the content to be responsive so that I may view it on desktop and mobile browsers. | The layout adapts to different screen sizes.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
